# Introduction

I'm created this book to include all basic knowledge's collection. Like:

1. How do setup vs code or any new settings or new extension exceptions use cases?
1. Best use of cmd commands randomly to resolve a specific problem?
1. Github-related setup or new things which make coding easy?
1. MySQL-related knowledge which might resolve some problems or some best use cases? Like the use of the index or fix MySQL error or specific error code solutions?

## This book is a collection of my knowledge which timely I found via google search or on-time coding.
## Also in this book, I tried to manage all in a group wise.
